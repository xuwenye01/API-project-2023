# Final project 2023 (Algorithms and Data Structures)

<p>This repository contains my personal implementation of the final project for the 2023 Algorithm and Data Structures course.

The aim of this year's project is to develop an efficient algorithm to calculate the **shortest path between two stations** (which are identified by a positive integer); if multiple minumum paths are found, the program must return **the one with the smallest station identifier** starting from the end of the path (for a more exhaustive description of the problem, please check the `specs` directory).</p>
